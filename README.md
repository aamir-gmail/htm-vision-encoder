In the repo , you will find code for encoding visual data (images) for HTM using
Keras auto-encoder.

I an using th spatial pooler to compare images in a unsupervised way.

To use the encoder ou will need a linux system (Ubuntu 18.04 x64) is preferred.
Start by downloading Mini-conda 3.7 x64, install conda tensorflow, pip install keras , pillow
and finally head over to HTM CORE and install there implementation of HTM.

The repo and all the code is self-contained with no outside dependency for data, to 
run the example make sure you clone this repo to your home directory and maintain
current folder structure.

I have provided comment in the code it self, for any other you can get in touch on
